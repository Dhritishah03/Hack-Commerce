# Hack-Commerce

This is our submission for Hack-Commerce 2023, hosted by MLH.

Our website navigates like any other E-commerce website but the main difference you will find is that, when you redirect to our cart, you can upload a CAD file with your custom design. This design is evaluated and assessed according to the dimensions and materials used and a cost is estimated. Once you give us your login/registration details, your product is ready to be created and shipped to your doorstep.

3D printing can be a fun and rewarding hobby, but it can also be a bit isolating without a community of other enthusiasts to share ideas and knowledge with. We would love to provide a platform for people to connect, share their designs, and collaborate on projects. 
This is only our vision for the near future. As this project starts working according to to its full potential we will surely bring more innovative and exciting updates.
